			<p class="blurb">Less focused on individuals than either Black Flags or Looming Tower, but it does focus heavily on ISIS's use of social media to recruit. I found the discussions and contrasts between Facebook and Twitter fascinating. tl;dr: the internet has real world impact, and neutrality is a clear political position.</p>

			<p class="blurb">It's kind of surprising how much of an impact Bell Labs has had on EECS. This book covers a few of the really momentous changes in electrical and systems engineering. A favorite moment -- the giant mylar balloon that was the world's first communications satellite. The last third of the book drags a little, partially because it covers the era when Bell Labs was mired in legal battles.</p>

			<p class="blurb">I'm so conflicted about this. I've read many reviews that both love and are horrified by this book. I agree that it's playing the queer tragedy trope poorly.
The main character's an accountant who joins the civil service of a colonial power in order to subvert it. I <3 everything about that premise, and I love the sheer amount of foreshadowing in the book. The author does a really good job of imposing a sense of doom over the whole story, and when the blow finally lands, it hurts no less for how expected it is.</p>

				★★
			</p>
			<p class="blurb">Interesting world (especially the mechanism for magic!), but a totally overpowered protagonist. Maybe this is because he's telling the story of his own life, and embellishing it somewhat. You can get away with a lot of lazy stereotypes when you have an arrogant unreliable narrator doing most of the book in first person. Also, I kind of found the emotions a little flat, but that might be because I'm coming off the intense emotions of the Neapolitan cycle, and everything's flat after Elena Ferrante. After the 10000th time Kvothe ends up in mortal danger, it doesn't really mean anything, since you know he'll get through it. Also, something about the way Kvothe describes women is irritating. I know it's probably just Kvothe, but I'm not really here for that. Not sure I want to read the second book.</p>
