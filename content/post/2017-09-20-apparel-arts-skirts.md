Last August, I started taking [pattern drafting courses at Apparel Arts](https://www.apparel-arts.com/certificate-program/), and I figured I'd write a little about how that's been, and what it involves!

The backbone of the ~2.5 year program is the self-paced patternmaking and design classes. The class teaches drafting, or flat patternmaking -- going from a set of measurements to a flat pattern that is then sewn up. This differs from draping, which involves sculpting fabric on a dress form (I'm taking that class now, though!)

The series is broken down into units that focus on a specific garment: skirts, manipulating darts and princess seamlines in bodices, collars and sleeves, pockets, and finally ending on pants. The class meets once a week for 3 hours, and there's about 3-5 hours of homework between classes (though that amount is variable!)

The first unit, skirts, takes the longest. The unit requires drafting and sewing 23 different skirts in muslin, and fitting them in class. It's an introduction to the basics of drafting and pattern manipulation techniques. 

The first assignment is making a sloper, which is a generic skirt with 2 darts in the front, and 2 darts in the back. That sloper can then be manipulated into a bunch of different skirts -- skirts with pleats, skirts with yokes, pencil skirts, flared skirts, and so on. Along the way, I got a pretty good understanding of what styles I like on me.

At the end of the unit, I had to design, draft, and sew 2 skirts in real fabric. I made one slightly strange skirt, and one basic one I knew I'd love and wear.


- structure of the class
  - draft and muslin a bunch of different style lines and exercises
  - start by drafting and sewing 23 different skirts in muslin
  - fit the skirts in class, and learn how to manipulate the patterns. for ex: princess seam lines for me!!
- what drafting is
  - sloper: a fitted base pattern that you can manipulate into other shapes and lines
  - example: darts --> yoke
  - example: darts --> princess seam flare
- final skirts
  - princess seams w/pockets
  - pencil?
  - flared skirt with pockets?
