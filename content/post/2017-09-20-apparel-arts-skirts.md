- classes at Apparel Arts
  - blurb about what apparel arts is, and their 2-year certification program
  - self-paced patternmaking classes: skirts, moulage, etc.

The patternmaking and design classes is a self-paced system, where you work through 12 units in an average of 24 months. The units start with skirts, then progress through different kinds of bodices and shirts, through to sleeves and collars, ending on pants.

You start on skirts -- drafting and sewing 23 different skirts in muslin, and fitting them in class. The first assignment is making a sloper, which is a generic skirt with 2 darts that you learn how to manipulate into different patterns.
