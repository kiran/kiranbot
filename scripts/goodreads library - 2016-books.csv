This book covers a few of the really momentous changes in electrical and systems engineering. A favorite moment -- the giant mylar balloon that was the world's first communications satellite.

The main character's an accountant who joins the civil service of a colonial power in order to subvert it. I <3 everything about that premise, and I love the sheer amount of foreshadowing in the book.

Maybe this is because he's telling the story of his own life, and embellishing it somewhat. You can get away with a lot of lazy stereotypes when you have an arrogant unreliable narrator doing most of the book in first person. Also, I kind of found the emotions a little flat, but that might be because I'm coming off the intense emotions of the Neapolitan cycle, and everything's flat after Elena Ferrante. After the 10000th time Kvothe ends up in mortal danger, it doesn't really mean anything, since you know he'll get through it. Also, something about the way Kvothe describes women is irritating. I know it's probably just Kvothe, but I'm not really here for that. Not sure I want to read the second book.",fantasy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
