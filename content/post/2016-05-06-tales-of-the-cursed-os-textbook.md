title: Tales of the Cursed Operating Systems Textbook

I gave this talk at [!!con 2016](http://bangbangcon.com/2016/speakers.html#kiran-bhattaram), and also at [Stripe's Lightning Talks and Pies](https://stripe.com/events/lightning-talks-and-pie-dec2016) event, a few months later.

## Abstract

I have a cursed operating systems textbook — each chapter I read unearths a new bug in the systems I work on. Come hear my tales of woe:

- the chapter on kernel data structures that conjured up memory leaks INSIDE THE KERNEL!
- the catastrophic slowdown caused by the syscalls chapter, narrowly averted by the magic of strace!
- the networking chapter and the 200ms slowdown in EVERY network call we were making!
- AND MORE!

Along our journey, we’ll acquire some fantastic operating systems tools and incantations you can use to vanquish even the scariest bugs!
