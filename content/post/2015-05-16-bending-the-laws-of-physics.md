Learn how adding more antennas lets you squeeze more information out of the air! (Note: this is actually the coolest!) Along the way, we'll discuss what the silly numbers and letters on your router mean, and the fantastic bag of signal processing and programming tricks that lets you carry the internet around in your pocket!
